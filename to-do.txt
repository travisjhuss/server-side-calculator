**** STRETCH GOALS ****

    [x] - make look like calculator and function as such
    [ ] - Only allow the POST call to happen if all necessary input is ready.
            [ ] - dont accept is there is an operator with no number after
            [ ] - if equals button is hit when zero dont run
    [ ] - Allow a user to clear the history by clicking on a button. 
          Technically this shouldn't be a GET or a POST. Look into making a DELETE request!
    [ ] - Allow a user to click on an entry in the History list to re-run that calculation. 
          This should display the answer on the calculator interface like a normal calculation.
